Here the software is written in C ++ and it is programed to the microcontroller to obtain voltage and current sense values and the rotary encoder controls the MCP 4725 module according to the values set on the LCD display, and op-amp drives the MOSFET and draws current through the FET bank. 

With the increase of the temperature in the FET bank the fan speed increases in several steps. This helps to prevent FET bank from overheating.
